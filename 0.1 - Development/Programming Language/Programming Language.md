# C/C++
[[C/C++]] is the first language that I learned in my academia. I have learnt basic data structures and object oriented programming along with all the basics of programming with this language. I wish to go pro-mode with this language in future.

# SQL
My first database language

# JavaScript
My go to language for web applications. I mostly develop applications with [[React]], [[NodeJS]], [[MongoDB]], [[Express]] aka MERN Stack. I now depend mostly on [[NextJS]] which is another [[React]] framework.
