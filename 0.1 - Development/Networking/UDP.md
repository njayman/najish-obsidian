UDP is User Datagram Protoccol. It is a connectionless protocol.
- Here, unlike TCP, the packets don't contain data of order of packets. So the header size is 8 bytes which is smaller than TCP.
- No acknowledgement of packets is required. The client directly sends data packets to the server.
- Packet loss are ignored. No contingency for packet loss.
- No ordered delivery of packets.
- No congestion control.
