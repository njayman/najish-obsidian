There are two types of scaling:
1. Vertical scaling
2. Horizontal scaling

Vertical Scaling scales the server in terms of raw power. Increases the server CPU/RAM/ROM to handle high usage.

- Not ideal as it can be costly.
- Single point of failure. That is, if the server goes down. The system is dwn.

Horizontal Scaling duplicates the server instance.
- Cheaper and ideal option
- No single point of failure. If one server fails, other servers ar there to serve.
